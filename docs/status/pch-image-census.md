# Declaration image fallback census: every libc++ header in a purview (WP-1070, 2026-11-10)

How much of the standard library the declaration image (spec/modules.md
§11.11 "Part 2a") carries once locations in other files and in macro
expansions are carried (stage S7, WP-1070), counted with
`-fkiln-bmi-image-census` (spec/modules.md §11.11 "Fallback census").
This is the first measurement for the real PCH: a header that a PCH
or a header unit holds is a purview like this one.

## Setup

- kiln at the WP-1070 branch, debug build (`cargo build -p kiln_driver`).
- libc++ 19.1.7 (`/usr/include/c++/v1`), aarch64 Linux, `-std=c++26`.
- `allstd.cppm` is `export module allstd; export { ... }` with one
  `#include <h>` per header, in alphabetical order: the 105 public
  libc++ 19 headers without an extension (`ls /usr/include/c++/v1 |
  grep -v '^__\|\.'`, less `experimental` and `ext`) and
  `<stdatomic.h>`, 106 in all.

```
kiln++ -std=c++26 -stdlib=libc++ -fkiln-bmi-image -fkiln-bmi-image-census \
  --precompile allstd.cppm -o allstd.pcm
```

Wall 11.7 s, peak RSS 107 MiB (debug build, census included).

The purview is not a valid module unit, and the census is not a claim
that it should compile: the C library headers it pulls in declare
entities with internal linkage that the `export` block exports, and
redeclare global-module entities (`operator new`, `_IO_FILE`) in the
module. kiln reports 16 errors and writes no module file; clang 19.1.7
and clang 22.1.8 reject the same command (without the kiln flags) with
20 errors (0.59 s / 165 MiB and 0.69 s / 161 MiB). The census is
computed from the parsed purview regardless, which is what it is for:
each top-level declaration is counted under the first reason the image
refuses it.

## Result

Reasons in the order of the census output (most frequent first). The
example is the first refused declaration of that reason in source
order; paths are relative to `/usr/include/c++/v1` unless absolute, and
`<resource>` is kiln's resource directory. A `cascade:` reason is the
consequence of an earlier refusal (the declaration names something not
in the image).

The second table counts, for the declarations refused for their
attributes, how many carry each attribute (a declaration counts once
per attribute name; `(unnamed)` is an attribute kiln keeps without a
spelled name).

## Reading

- Locations no longer block anything material: the only location
  fallback left is 2 declarations whose location is in `<built-in>`
  (`hardware_destructive_interference_size`, through
  `__GCC_DESTRUCTIVE_SIZE`). Before S7 the whole unit fell back at its
  first location outside the main file.
- The largest single cause is attributes, nearly all of them from
  `_LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI` (`visibility`, `abi_tag`,
  `exclude_from_explicit_instantiation`) and `_LIBCPP_TEMPLATE_VIS`
  (`type_visibility`). Carrying these four attributes is the next step
  with the most effect.
- Reserved identifiers (`__x`, `_X`) are refused by the name gate,
  which guards the importer's preprocessor against clashes; it goes
  when S5 replaces the gate with ODR merging.
- Templates (the template, pack, constraint, default argument, alias
  template and member template rows and "a declaration in a template",
  about 4.6 thousand together) are the S4 follow-ups.
- The cascade rows (about 2 thousand) mostly disappear with their
  causes: `max_align_t`'s unnamed-class typedef, and the
  using-declarations of `cstddef`, `cstdio` and the other C wrappers,
  which name C library declarations the image refused first.

## WP-1278: attributes, reserved names and scopes (2026-11-11)

The same purview and command, at the WP-1278 branch (debug build): wall
17.7 s, peak RSS 114 MiB, the same 16 errors.

```
before (WP-1070): 25544 top-level declarations, 10938 carried, 14606 not
after (WP-1278):  26898 top-level declarations, 16775 carried, 10123 not
```

There are more top-level declarations because the linkage
specifications and namespaces `std` that were refused whole are now
scopes, so their members count on their own. The rows WP-1278 targets:

| reason | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| a declaration with attributes | 4020 | 0 |
| a reserved identifier (`__x`, `_X`) | 2619 | 0 |
| an implicit declaration that is not a special member (LinkageSpec) | 263 | 0 |
| a linkage specification | 27 | 0 |
| a typedef naming an unnamed class | 18 | 0 |
| a declaration named `std` or `main` | 13 | 0 |
| an inline or unnamed namespace | 10 | 0 |
| cascade: a using-declaration naming a declaration outside the image | 848 | 303 |
| cascade: a type declared outside the image | 859 | 743 |

The rows that replace them are narrower:

- "an attribute the image does not carry yet" (41): `preferred_name`
  (18, which names a type), `diagnose_if` (12), `aligned` (6),
  `alignas` (3) and `enable_if` (2);
- "an exception specification the image does not carry" (63), "a
  declaration with side data the image does not carry" (37), "a
  parameter with an adjusted type or a pack" (36), "a declaration not
  named by an identifier" (30) and "a C linkage specification in a
  namespace" (2) are first reasons of declarations that the removed
  rows used to stop earlier.

The template rows grew (for example "a declaration in a template" 1595
to 1686, "cascade: a specialization of a template outside the image"
199 to 655, "a type the image does not carry" 38 to 368) because the
declarations now reach the template checks. They are WP-1279's. Of the
type kinds refused as "a type the image does not carry", all but about
17 are dependent (a dependent name 618, a pack expansion 215,
`auto` 167, `decltype` 142, a dependent-size array 61, a unary
transform 28; counted per attempt). The non-dependent ones are
`decltype` (6), `auto` (4), vector types (4) and member pointers (3).
All 116 of "a declaration the image does not carry yet" are the body
of a requires-expression (`RequiresExprBody`), also WP-1279's.

## Re-running

The purview file is generated as described in "Setup"; the census
prints on stderr after the compile's diagnostics. The image itself, and
the module file when the unit is valid, are the same with and without
`-fkiln-bmi-image-census` (`kind2_image_census` in
`crates/kiln_driver/tests/modules_bmi.rs`).
