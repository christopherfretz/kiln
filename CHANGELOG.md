# Changelog

All notable changes to kiln are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and kiln adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). What a
version number promises is in [docs/STABILITY.md](docs/STABILITY.md).

## [1.0.0] - unreleased

The first release. This section summarises what kiln 1.0 does. Measured
results are in [docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md), and the
limits are in [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md).

### Language

- C++98 through C++23, and C++26 as in the Croydon DIS draft: 257 of the
  260 rows of [docs/STANDARD_SUPPORT.md](docs/STANDARD_SUPPORT.md) are
  done. P2686, P2786 and P3394 are partial.
- C++26 static reflection (P2996, `<meta>`), on by default at
  `-std=c++26` (`-fno-reflection` turns it off).
- C++26 contracts (P2900): `pre`, `post`, `contract_assert`, the four
  evaluation semantics (`-fcontract-evaluation-semantic=`), and a
  replaceable violation handler.
- C++20 modules, header units and `import std;`, in one invocation or in
  clang's two-step build: `--precompile`, `-fmodule-output`,
  `-fmodule-file=`, `-fprebuilt-module-path=`. kiln's module files are
  its own format.
- Coroutines, exceptions, RTTI, `thread_local`, and clang's and GCC's
  common extensions and builtins.

### Constant evaluation (the Oven)

- All constant evaluation (`constexpr`, `consteval`, `static_assert`,
  template arguments, reflection) runs in the Oven, kiln's bytecode
  evaluator. It has exact per-evaluation budgets for steps, depth and
  live memory (`-fconstexpr-steps=`, `-fconstexpr-depth=`,
  `-fconstexpr-memory=`), and memory freed during an evaluation is
  reclaimed during that evaluation.
- On kiln's benchmark corpus, compared with clang 19: geometric mean
  0.21x the time and 0.17x the peak memory
  ([docs/status/perf.md](docs/status/perf.md)).
- Reports: `-fconstexpr-report=` (NDJSON per evaluation),
  `-fkiln-instantiation-report`, `-fkiln-memory-report`.

### Standard libraries and compatibility

- libc++ 22.1.8 test suite at `-std=c++26`: 99.2%. libc++ 19.1.7: 98.3%.
  Every public libstdc++ 14 header compiles at `-std=c++20` and
  `-std=c++26`.
- 47 open-source projects built with their own build systems and test
  suites, including all of LLVM, Boost, folly, Abseil, DuckDB and CMake:
  43 at parity with clang 19 on every test.
- clang-compatible command line and predefined macros. CMake and
  autotools work unchanged. kiln reproduces clang 22 by default and
  clang 19 with `-fclang-compat=19`.

### Code generation and tools

- Writes LLVM IR as text and drives LLVM's tools. It never links against
  LLVM. Supports LLVM 19 and LLVM 22.
  <!-- update when WP-1016 lands: LLVM discovery, default 22 -->
- Itanium C++ ABI as clang implements it, on Linux aarch64 and x86_64.
- `-O0` to `-O3`, `-Os`, `-Oz`; LTO (`-flto`, `-flto=thin`);
  floating-point model flags; AArch64 branch protection.
- DWARF debug information (`-g` and its levels, `-gdwarf-N`) that gdb and
  lldb read as they read clang's.
- Sanitizers: address, hwaddress, thread, memory, leak, fuzzer, and
  undefined behaviour.
- Coverage: `--coverage` (gcov) and `-fprofile-instr-generate`
  counters. Coverage mapping and PGO are not in 1.0.

### Robustness and distribution

- An internal compiler error prints a report and writes a reproducer
  (`.ii` and `.sh`) instead of a panic
  ([docs/REPORTING-BUGS.md](docs/REPORTING-BUGS.md)). kiln runs out of
  stack only as a diagnostic.
- Every crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. The MSRV is Rust 1.95.
- Release archives from `cargo xtask dist`: relocatable,
  `kiln-<version>-<triple>.tar.xz` with a stripped binary, plus a
  `-symbols` archive and `SHA256SUMS`.

## Before 1.0

Before 1.0 kiln was developed in the open on `main`, at version 0.0.1,
with no tagged releases. The history is in the git log, the milestones
in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md), and each work package's record in
[docs/BACKLOG.md](docs/BACKLOG.md) and `spec/landed/`.
